I'm a Data Analyst who has dabbled in various aspects of Data Science over the years. 

I started as a Business Analyst working with ton loads of NPI data, fell head-first into the world of Data Science and moved to the US to pursue my Masters in Business Analytics.
It's been a really fulfilling journey since then - revisiting Statistics, learning Python on my own and exploring Machine Learning. My experience at grad school and the several internships I did while there has been a truly enriching experience and provided a strong foundation to my interests.

In addition to my graduate degree, I've taken complete advantage of the myriad of online courses available for Data Science. I've completed and/or audited multiple courses on Coursera, edX, Udemy and Udacity. And of course, Kaggle! I've enjoyed working on the datasets in Kaggle for my personal projects as much as I enjoyed scraping websites for creating my own datasets. I really enjoy reading Data Science articles on Medium and occasionally write my own experiences about working on a project. 

I've worked on Data Collection, Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis, Feature Engineering and Machine Learning. It's a belief that Data Scientists do not usually like cleaning datasets which accounts to a major part of their responsibilities, but I absolutely love it. While I do enjoy everything Data Science has to offer, data cleaning and wrangling is one of my favorite things-to-do with data. It's your introduction to the data and the various mysteries it holds. It is as important as it is interesting! 

My skillset is diverse since I've worked as a Business Analyst, Data Analyst and Business Intelligence Intern. I'm proficient in transforming and extracting data using SQL, Python (pandas is a godsend!) and good old MS Excel. I have hands on experience working on Tableau for creating visualizations. I understand business requirements and the importance of using analytics to drive growth. I'm acutely aware of how much a great visualization can impact business decisions. And
